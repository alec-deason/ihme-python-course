# Function Decomposition

Everyone has the same exercise this time.  The object here is exactly the same as in the class exercise:
take some code with lots of repetition and try to decompose it into a set of self-describing functions.

There are no automated tests for this version. The output statistics should stay the same, but 
you are welcome to change the formatting of the statistics. When you feel satisfied with your work,
flag down a TA and have them look over your solution.
