## Importing Packages
Python is a 'batteries included' language, meaning it comes with a great deal of 
functionality out of the box. Most of this functionality is stored in the Python Standard Library.
You can access this functionality by importing a package from the Standard Library like 
```
> import math
```
You can then use the functions in the imported library like
```
> math.sqrt(9)
3.0
```
You can also import specific functions from a library.
```
> from math import sqrt
```
And then call them:
```
> sqrt(9)
3.0
```
You can read more about the standard library on the [Python Website](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html).
