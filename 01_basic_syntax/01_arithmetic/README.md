# Arithmetic Operators in Python

Python supports all the basic mathematical operations you're familiar with as well as
a few you may not know.

Assume we have two variables: `a` which holds the value 10 and `b` which holds the value 21.

| **Operator**        | **Description**                                                                     | **Example**                                                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Addition:`+`        |Adds values on either side of the operator.                                          | `a + b = 31`                                                  |
| Subtraction:`-`     |	Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.                                | `a - b = -11`                                                 |
| Multiplication:`*`  |Multiplies values on either side of the operator                                     | `a * b = 210`                                                 |
| Division:`\`        | Divides left hand operand by right hand operand                                     | `b / a = 2.1`                                                 |
| Modulus:`%`         | Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder               | `b % a = 1`                                                   |
| Exponent:`**`       | Raises the left hand operand to the power of the right hand operand                 | `a**b = 10 to the power 21`                                   |
| Floor Division:`\\` | Divides the left hand operand by the right hand operand and rounds the result down. | `9//2 = 4 and 9.0//2.0 = 4.0`  `-11//3 = -4, -11.0//3 = -4.0` |
