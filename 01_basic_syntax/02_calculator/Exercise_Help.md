## Comparison Operators
| **Operator**              | **Description**                                                                                                  | **Example**                    |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Equality:`==`             | If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.                                        | `(a == b) is not True.`        |
| Inequality:`!=`           | If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.                                            | `(a != b) is True.`            |
| Strictly Greater Than:`>` | If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.            | `(a > b) is not True.`         |
| Strictly Less Than:`<`    | If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.               | `(a < b) is True.`             |
| Greater Than:`>=`         | If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.| `(a >= b) is not True.`        |
| Less Than:`<=`            | If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.   | `(a <= b) is True.`            |

## If statements
1. The colon (:) is significant and required. It separates the header of the compound statement from the body.
2. The line after the colon must be indented. It is standard in Python to use four spaces for indenting.
3. All lines indented the same amount after the colon will be executed whenever the BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION is true.
